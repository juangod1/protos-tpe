IESG Note

	This protocol is to be used by a server and a client to express
	decisions about the interaction between them in order to fullfil
	the tasks of live administration of the proxy server.

1. Introduction

	The purpose of this document is to standarize interaction between
	administrator users and proxyPOP3 server for POP3.
	This will provide the correct mechanisms to successfully communicate
	with proxyPOP3 server performing changes to configuration and 
	retriving information on runtime.

	It is REQUIRED for the successful use of this protocol that the
	administrator knows the connection port. This is set by default to
	9090 but it can be changed.

2. Communication model

	We can identify 2 types of users:
		-Administrator: is the one that connects to the proxyPOP3
		server in order to change configurations and ask for
		statistics
		-Proxy server: is the process that runs between the MUA
		and the POP3 server and has the statistics and
		configurations to be changed.
	There will only be one proxy running but many administrators may 
	connect.
	Communication will be text-based.

2.1 Requests commands
	
	Commands in AP3P consist of a case-sensitive keyword followed by
	one or none arguments. All commands are terminated by a CRLF "\r\n".
	Keywords and arguments consist of printable ASCII characters and are
	separated by a single SPACE character. There is a reserved character
	"@" that is used to escape SPACE character from that point until the
	termination of the request.

	Example: 
		"USER juan\r\n"....................................CORRECT
		"USER juan \r\n".................................INCORRECT

2.2 Responses

	Responses from the proxy server may have up to 512 characters and
	are terminated with a CRLF pair "\r\n\r\n".
	These responses contain a response status indicator separated by a
	SPACE"-"SPACE and followed by a description.
	
	Responses status might be:
		-"+OK"..........................................AFIRMATIVE
		-"-ERR"...........................................NEGATIVE
		-"*SPC"............................................SPECIAL

	Negative responses indicate that the command requested is unknown or 
	migth not follow correct format. This status is also used when request
	is not done in proper state.
	Special responses are provided for further information that cannot
	be classified as AFIRMATIVE nor NEGATIVE.
	

2.3 Handling inactivity

	The proxy server MAY implement an inactivity counter to handle idle
	administrators. If so, it MUST be of at least 10 minutes. Whenever
	a request is received from an administrator, this counter MUST be 
	reseted.
	Furthermore if counter is implemented, NOOP command MUST also be
	implemented, to provide administrators a command to reset counter
	without performing any action and without negatives response.

3. Communication process

	The process of communication is splited into different states. This 
	will be identified by their corresponding starting events. Inside each
	event there are sets of commands that MUST be implemented by the proxy
	server and these MUST be exclusively available in their corresponding 
	state.

3.1 States

3.1.2 AUTHENTICATION
	
	Starting event: after client connects to proxy servers' port and the
	proxy server answers with a greeting.
	Description: Through this state the administrator MUST identify and
	the proxy server MUST authenticate if it corresponds.
	Steps:
		1. open SCTP connection on port 9090.
		2. server MUST send greeting.
		3. admin MUST identify, using USER & PASS mechanisms.
		4. server MUST authenticate.
		5. if valid server MUST send afirmative response and state is
		changed to EXCHANGE
		6. if not, server MUST send negative response and MAY close
		connection.
		7. if not closed, admin MAY retry authentication or use QUIT.

		Commands:
		USER name
			Arguments: name is a string that contain username
			Possible responses: "+OK"
			Function: Allows admin to provide username to identify.
			Answer MUST always be positive to avoid providing 
			information.
		PASS string
			Arguments: string is the password to try with previous
			provided username
			Possible responses: "+OK"/"-ERR"
			Function: Allows admin to provide password to 
			authenticate. Proxy server must check authentication 
			and if its positive, state is now EXCHANGE.

3.1.2 EXCHANGE
	
	Starting event: after proxy server responding that admin has been 
	successfully identified.
	Description: Through this state the administrator MAY request for 
	actions or information through available commands.
	Steps:
		1. admin MUST provide a well formated command
		2. server answers with the corresponding status and info.
		3. admin MAY repeat commands until QUIT or inactivity counter 
		reaches 0 if implemented.

		Commands:
		LISTS
			Arguments: none
			Possible responses: "+OK"
			Function: server MUST provide available options to 
			request for statistics throught STATS command.
		STATS number
			Arguments: number is an int REQUIRED that indicates 
			which statistics to retrive.
			Possible responses: "+OK"/"-ERR"
			Function: Allows admin to ask for statistics 
			information available. 
		ACTIVE [bool]
			Argument: bool is an optional argument that indicates 
			if filter is active (1) or not (0).
			Possible responses: "+OK"/"-ERR"
			Function: server MUST change filter configuration if 
			argument is correct. If argument is null, then server 
			MUST provide current configuration.
		FILTER [cmd]
			Argument: cmd is an optional string that indicates the
			name of a system(3) compatible command. Administrator 
			MUST know if command wont work correctly.
			Possible responses: "+OK"
			Function: server MUST change command filter 
			configuration if argument is correct. If argument is 
			null, then server MUST provide current command 
			configuration.	

3.1.2 CLOSE
	
	Starting event: after administrator sends QUIT or in case of 
	implemented counter, when this one ends.
	Description: Connection is closed by the proxy server. If by any 
	reason connection is not closed, sate MUST be changed to CLOSE in 
	order to suspend any further command usage, since only QUIT will be 
	accepted.

									[PAGE 3]

3.2 Global commands

	This commands might be used from any of the states

	QUIT
		Arguments: none
		Possible response: "+OK"
		Function: proxy server MUST change state to CLOSE and close 
		SCTP connection with the administrator.

3.2 Procedure

	1. administrator opens SCTP connection to port 9090(default)
	2. proxy server responds with greeting
	3. now entering AUTHENTICATION state
	4. client identifies with username and password.
	5. server verifys this credentials and responds "+OK"/"-ERR"
	6. if "+OK", now entering EXCHANGE state. if "-ERR" then step 3
	7. administrator now can perform all commands available in EXCHANGE.
	8. upon QUIT command, state becomes CLOSE and connection is closed.

4. Comments
	
	This section is ment to explain some particular characteristics that 
	the protocol has. 

4.1 Special character "@"

	This character is ment to indicate SPACE escape from that character up
	to the end of the line. It is valid to use "@ACTIVE" since this 
	command does not require any parameter but "@ACTIVE 0" wont work since
	it MUST be considered one only string. The purpose of this special 
	character is to allow the administrator provide "SPACE using" commands
	to the proxy filter. Example: "FILTER @sed s/o/0/g|sed s/a/4/g"

4.2 Commands and Parameters

	Since all commands have 1 or none arguments split by a single SPACE 
	character, if "@" is not used then whenever request consists of more 
	than one SPACE is considered bad format. By this, it can also be 
	infered that if request starts with SPACE, thenthere is no command 
	keyword provided.
